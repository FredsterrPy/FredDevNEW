		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a programmer who knows HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and RobloxLua. <br> I started coding at age 7 and 2 years later Loves it. I first wanted to start when I became top of the class in computing and wanted a bit <br>more of a challenge so I decided to learn RobloxLua from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1R0TBvgM7gj0rwTYULmSA" target="_blank"><br>AlvinBlox</a>. It was a fun time learning and making things and then I learnt Python from a few books. I then started making tutorials on my <br>youtube channel in 2020 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBddmR4N6v7RXTvjgBi5Tim80SkbUuAA5" target="_blank">Click here <br>for a link. <br></a> Then I learnt HTML CSS and JavaScript from Chris Dixon and Rich Armstrong's skillshare courses. That's how I am making this website!</p>
